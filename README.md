> ## Recognizing Handwritten Digits (MNIST)
A backpropagation network with 3 layers implemented to recognized 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits.
60,000 training images were used and 10,000 testing images.
[Results for the MNIST Network](https://github.com/luisschubert/artificialNeuralNetwork/blob/master/mnistResults.md)




## Future Work
- [ ] visualize the weights with a bokeh heatmap
- [ ] implement an alternative train and query method for CIFAR
